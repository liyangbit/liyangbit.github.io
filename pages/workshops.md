A Data Carpentry workshop teaches the core skills for working with data effectively and reproducibly.

When working with data, it's often difficult to figure out what skills to learn or how to get started learning them. In Data Carpentry, we identify the fundamental skills needed in a given domain and develop and teach these skills in hands-on, two-day, interactive workshops. Workshops are
currently designed for people with little to no prior computational experience and are domain-specific, so that researchers are working with data most relevant to their own work. They follow a narrative structure, working with one dataset through the whole data lifecycle from data and project organization to data analysis and visualization.  

We currently have curriculum in:

- [Ecology](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop)
- [Genomics](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#genomics-workshop)
- [Geospatial data](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#geospatial-data-workshop)

**Data Carpentry workshops must include:**

- **A Data Carpentry lesson on data organization**
- **Three other modules in the same domain from the [Data Carpentry curriculum](../lessons/)**

Interested in learning more? See our [Lessons](../lessons/) page with links to all our lessons and information about topics and domains under development.
