The host is responsible for ensuring that the workshop is accessible to all participants.  
For self-organized workshops, the lead instructor is often also the host.

Be sure that:

- [ ] Your registration form asks learners if they need any advance arrangements (e.g. sign-language interpreters, large-print handouts, lactation facilities)  
- [ ] You ask co-instructors and helpers if they need any advance arrangements  
- [ ] You send out links to workshop materials in advance so that learners can adapt them if needed  
- [ ] The building and room are accessible to those who cannot use stairs  
- [ ] Elevators are available throughout the scheduled time for your workshop  
- [ ] There are accessible restrooms nearby  
- [ ] The room can accommodate service animals  
- [ ] There is a microphone for instructors  
- [ ] The projector screen is large enough to be easily read  

If learners, instructors, or helpers indicate that advance arrangements are needed, the host needs to follow-up on this to make sure things are ready. The host institution may have a "Disability Services Office" that can help with physical arrangements.
