**Information on Data Carpentry's responsibilities for centrally-organized workshops.**

For centrally-organized workshops, the Data Carpentry workshop coordinator supports workshop hosts by taking care of all non-local workshop logistics. Hosts are reponsible for local logistics. For more details on the host's responsibilities, see the [host checklist](/host-checklist/).  

*If your workshop is self-organized, the host is responsible for <u>all</u> logistics. See the [self-organized host/lead-instructor checklist](/self-org-lead/) for hosting responsibilities for self-organized workshops.*

For centrally-organized workshops, our workshop coordinator:  

- [ ] Assists hosts in selecting an appropriate time and location for their workshop and provides other guidance on local logistics.  
- [ ] Recruits and selects instructors meeting the host's requirements.  
- [ ] Assists hosts in recruiting local helpers (if requested).  
- [ ] Sets up the pre- and post-workshop surveys for instructors to distribute to learners.  
- [ ] Communicates with instructors to ensure planning and teaching are going smoothly.  
- [ ] Sets up and administers the workshop registration page.

- [ ] Helps advertise the workshop on the Data Carpentry Twitter feed and discussion list (if requested).

- [ ] Coordinates sharing of pre- and post-workshop survey responses with hosts and instructors.
