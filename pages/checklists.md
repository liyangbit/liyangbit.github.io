Preparing to run or host a Data Carpentry workshop involves coordinating efforts among several people. To help
simplify this process, we've put together a set of checklists and other resources to clarify who is responsible
for what activities and to collect all of the links and materials you will need in one place.  

Please use these
checklists as simplified guides for putting together your workshop. If you need more information about the
different types of workshops, check out our [self-organized](/self-organized-workshops/) and 
[centrally-organized](/workshops-host/) workshop pages or contact the Data Carpentry workshop coordinator 
at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org).
