### Recruiting co-instructors

Hi [name],
I’m organizing a local Data Carpentry workshop for [estimated month/season of workshop]. Data Carpentry is a non-profit organization that helps researchers learn how to manage and analyze their data in efficient and reproducible ways. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using domain-specific datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they’ve learned to their own work. I’m really excited about using the Data Carpentry curriculum here to help our [graduate students/staff/faculty - your target audience] become more efficient in their research.

I’ve gone through instructor training for Data Carpentry and am certified to teach their materials. To run a workshop, I’ll need at least one (preferably two) co-instructors to help out in teaching the material. The workshops are two days long and instructors usually switch off every half day. I’m planning to cover [your workshop topics] and was hoping you could teach the [topic] section of the workshop. Data Carpentry provides ready-to-go lesson materials, so we wouldn’t need to develop anything from scratch. If you’re interested, you can see the materials for [topic] here [link to lesson] and the rest of their curricular materials here [link to http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/].  

I’m looking forward to running a workshop here and think it will be very helpful to our [target audience]. If you’re interested in being an instructor, please let me know and we can get together and plan. Also let me know if you know anyone else who might be interested and able to help out with the [topic] part of the workshop.

Looking forward to working with you on this!

## For all workshops

### Recruiting helpers

Hi [name],
I’m running a Data Carpentry workshop on [dates of workshop]. Data Carpentry is a non-profit organization that helps researchers learn how to manage and analyze their data in efficient and reproducible ways. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using domain-specific datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they’ve learned to their own work. I’m really excited about using the Data Carpentry curriculum here to help our [graduate students/staff/faculty - your target audience] become more efficient in their research.

During the workshop, I’ll need a few people to help out in case learners run into problems or get stuck. Helpers move around the room to answer questions and help learners work through things like installation problems, error messages and unexpected output. You don’t need to be an expert in the tools we’re covering, just to have used one or more of them and be comfortable helping people troubleshoot. At this workshop, we’re planning on covering [list of your topics]. I think you would be a great person to help out with [topic]. If you’re interested, you can see the materials for [topic] here [link to lesson] and the rest of the curricular materials here [link to http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/]. Please let me know if you’re interested in being a helper and if you know anyone else who might be willing to help out.

Best,

### Advertising your workshop  

[Name of organization] DATA CARPENTRY WORKSHOP
[Dates of workshop, location] 

On [dates], [organization name] is hosting a Data Carpentry workshop for [target audience/domain]. Data Carpentry teaches the introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. Their mission is to provide researchers high-quality, friendly training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. Lessons are domain specific, and this workshop is focused on [domain]. The curriculum will include:

- [names of lessons]
- [names of lessons]
- [names of lessons]
- [names of lessons]

The target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience, and the instructors put a priority on creating a friendly environment to empower researchers and enable data-driven discovery. Even those with some experience will benefit, as the goal is to teach not only how to do analyses, but how to manage the process to make it as automated and reproducible as possible.

Space is limited and it will likely fill quickly. [Add sentence about whether workshop is free or if there is a fee.]. Here is a registration link [link to your registration page], and the workshop webpage [link to your workshop webpage] for more information. Questions? Send email to [email contact].

We hope to see you at the workshop!

### Email learners before workshop   

Hello,  

We are excited for the Data Carpentry workshop this coming [days of week] and hope you are too. A few notes:  

Be sure to complete the pre-workshop survey [link to survey]. We use this to calibrate the pace of the workshop and, together with a post-workshop survey, to assess how it went.  

Make sure you have the necessary software installed on your laptop [list required software for your workshop]. Here are the instructions [link to instructions]. If you have any trouble, send us an email or come a little early [day of week] morning. Someone will be there by [time] to help with installation issues.  

[Say if you will be providing coffee, snacks, and/or lunch. Include time of lunch break if not providing lunch.] 

If you won’t be able to attend, please let us know so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waitlist. 

Some links that will be used in the workshop: workshop page [link to workshop page], lesson materials [link to lesson materials], etherpad [link to workshop etherpad].  

Getting to the workshop: [add directions to your workshop location]  

Please read the Data Carpentry Code of Conduct [http://www.datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/] so that we all are aware of how to treat each other respectfully.  

We are committed to making sure that the workshop is accessible to everyone. Please tell us if there is anything we should know in advance in order to make the workshop accessible for you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, large-print handouts, lactation facilities).

Let us know if you have any questions, otherwise we will see you [day of week] morning!  

Looking forward to seeing you soon,
