**Information on host responsibilities for centrally-organized workshops.**

For centrally-organized workshops, hosts are reponsible for all local workshop logistics. The Data Carpentry workshop coordinator supports workshop hosts by taking care of all non-local workshop logistics. For more details on the workshop coordinator's role, see the [administrative checklist](/admin/).

*If your workshop is self-organized, the host is responsible for <u>all</u> logistics. See the [self-organized host/lead-instructor checklist](/self-org-lead/) for hosting responsibilities for self-organized workshops.*
