In 2016 Data Carpentry drafted its vision and mission statements to direct the organization's work, activities and future planning.

### Data Carpentry Vision
<br>
    *Building communities teaching universal data literacy*

### Data Carpentry Mission
<br>
Data Carpentry trains researchers in the core data skills for efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices. We run accessible, inclusive training workshops; teach openly available, high-quality, domain-tailored lessons; and foster an active, inclusive, diverse instructor community that promotes and models reproducible research as a community norm.
