After finishing the two day instructor training course, you will complete three short tasks in order to become a
certified Carpentry instructor. Detailed information about these tasks can be found on the [instructor
training website](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/). Please use the checklist below
as a quick reference, but be sure to read the detailed instructions first.

Please note that in the past, instructors needed to certify separately for Data and Software Carpentry. As of 
March 2017 that is no longer the case. Instructors who have already certified for either Data or Software Carpentry 
are now considered Carpentry instructors and can teach either set of curricula.

Tasks are listed in the order most of our instructor trainees complete the checkout process, but you can
complete them in any order.
