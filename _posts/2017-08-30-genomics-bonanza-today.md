Only a few more hours until the Genomics Issue Bonanza! Join the community in a hacky-day dedicated to
creating issues and simple PRs for cleaning up the Genomics lessons. You donâ€™t need to be an expert in
the materials - we need people to help search for broken links and typos too!

Click [here](https://tinyurl.com/ycqf9l2a) to see the event start in your local time.  

You can find more information, and sign up to participate, on the [event Etherpad](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/genomics-issue-bonanza).

Please come join the fun and help get the Genomics materials ready for publication!
