There's been a lot of exciting work on the [Genomics workshop materials](http://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/) over the past several months.
A massive reorganization of the materials is underway, splitting the workshop into two separate tracks - one including R
and the other including a variant-calling workflow. A host of folks have volunteered to serve as Maintainers for the revamped
lessons, and others have joined a Curriculum Advisory Committee to provide high-level guidance on the workshop as a whole.   

There's still a lot of work to do! It's all hands on deck for reorganizing the materials, and making sure they're up to date and 
clear before our first Genomics lesson release. Please help out however you can. You don't need to be a Genomics expert to contribute;
we need folks to check for broken links and typos too!  

We're holding an **Issue Bonanza** on 31 August to identify bugs and issues such as typos and broken links, followed by a two-day
**Bug BBQ** 18-19 September to clean everything up for publication.   

You can see these events in your local time at the links below. Please save these to your calendar now and stay tuned for more
information.    

[Issue Bonanza starting time](https://tinyurl.com/ycqf9l2a) - duration 24 hours  
[Bug BBQ date starting time](https://tinyurl.com/yblkcfgx) - duration 48 hours  

Looking forward to seeing you there!
