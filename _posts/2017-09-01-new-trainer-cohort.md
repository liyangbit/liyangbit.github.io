Software and Data Carpentry now have a brand-new batch of Trainers.
The new Trainers completed their training this week and will start to train new Instructors soon.
Adding this new cohort takes us up to 40 in Trainer numbers.

For those not familiar with our terminology, Trainers are the
people who train other people to be Data and Software Carpentry Instructors. This is done through a
two-day [instructor training course](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/) that may be delivered in person or
remotely. Trainers are vital to increasing our Instructor numbers, and thus to building our community worldwide.

The current cohort are from all over - the US, Greece, Thailand, Canada, South Africa, the UK, and the Netherlands - so this will be a great
boost for community-building in those countries.

Welcome aboard Amy Hodge, Anita Schürch, Alexander Konovalov,
Danielle Quinn, Elizabeth Wickes, Fotis Psomopoulos, François Michonneau, John Simpson, Juan Steyn, Kwasi Amoako Kwakwa,
Martin Dreyer, Paula Andrea Martinez, and Robert Davey.

We look forward to teaching with you.
